  <h1>Client / Developer Final Project – Report</h1>

  <h2>Client Report</h2>
  <p><strong>I chose my website content and images based on my goals for the site and the audience I wanted to reach, focusing on simple sections and clean visuals that matched my wireframe. I communicated with my developer through class discussions and messages, and although communication was mostly smooth, I sometimes needed to clarify details. My developer met my expectations by creating a clean, well-organized site that followed my design. In the future, I would give more detailed instructions early on and provide content sooner to keep the project on schedule.</p>

  <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
  <p><strong>As the lead developer, I managed the team by assigning specific child pages to junior developers and providing them with wireframes, color palettes, and content to ensure consistency. Communication with the client was regular and effective, though I needed to ensure materials were provided on time to stay on schedule. I published the site using GitHub Pages and shared the live link with the client for review. Overall, managing the site with GitHub was smooth, with attention needed for file organization and commits.

  <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
  <p><strong>As a junior developer, I communicated with team leads to clarify expectations for my assigned pages, including layout and color scheme. I understood my responsibilities for each site and was able to contribute by fully coding the child pages, following the design and style guidelines. I initially encountered some issues with committing and pushing changes on GitHub, but after guidance and practice, I was able to contribute without problems.

  <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
  <p><strong>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</strong><br>
  The most challenging part was managing multiple roles at once—client, lead developer, and junior developer. Balancing responsibilities and deadlines was stressful, but I overcame it by staying organized and communicating clearly with my teams.</p>

  <p><strong>What did you enjoy most about this project?</strong><br>
  I enjoyed seeing the final websites come together and learning how to collaborate like a real development team. It felt rewarding to see the designs actually become working websites.</p>

  <p><strong>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</strong><br>
  I would start gathering all images and content earlier and communicate more consistently with all teammates to avoid delays.</p>

  <p><strong>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</strong><br>
  Yes—this project helped me understand teamwork, deadlines, and GitHub version control, which are all important in professional web development. I feel more prepared to work on real projects because now I know how to communicate, plan, and code as part of a team.</p>
  <h2>Communication With Developer</h2>
  <p>I communicated with my lead developer mostly through class discussions and messaging. I shared content, explained my layout, and responded to requests for additional images. Communication was mostly smooth, but there were a few moments where I had to clarify what type of images or text I wanted.</p>

  <h2>Developer Expectations</h2>
  <p>Yes, my developer created a clean and organized site that matched my wireframe and the style I wanted. The pages were functional, and the layout followed the plan closely.</p>

  <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
  <p>Next time, I would provide more detailed instructions from the beginning, especially regarding fonts, spacing, and specific image placements. I would also check in more often to make sure everything stays on track.</p>
